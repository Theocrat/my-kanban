# my-kanban
A person single-user Kanban Board for task and time management

## Objective
A Kanban board is a fantastic tool for managing tasks. It allows people to manage their time,
priorities, and urgencies efficiently when doing any kind of systematic work. It is also very
simple to build, using drag-and-drop components similar to the ones in my 
[JSON Maker](https://theocrat.github.io/json-maker) project.

While Kanban boards are used in industry to help entire teams manage their effort jointly,
they can also be used by individuals to improve their own productivity. This project is intended
to use drag-and-drop SVG elements to build a user-friendly Kanban board for one person. It 
should be able to remember the placement of dragable blocks using the browser's local storage,
enabling it to run purely on the client side. It should be possible to import and export boards.

## Usage
```yml
TODO: Insert directions for usage of the tool
